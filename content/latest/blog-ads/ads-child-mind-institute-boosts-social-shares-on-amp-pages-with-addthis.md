		<p><em>Posted by Chad Edmonds, Director of Product Marketing, AddThis </em></p><p>AddThis has been excited to work with the AMP project over the past year, to ensure the web is fast and user-friendly for everyone. As AMP turns 3 years old this month, we’re celebrating the project’s progress with <a href="https://www.addthis.com/blog/2018/10/08/case-study-child-mind-institute-increases-mobile-traffic-with-addthis-share-buttons/#.W89MKhNKjOQ">a recent case study</a> showing increased shares and engagement using the AddThis AMP component. Happy birthday AMP!<br/><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2219 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=660" alt="addthis" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=660 660w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=150 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=300 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=768 768w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png?w=1024 1024w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/addthis.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw" width="660" height="347"></amp-img></p><p>Child Mind Institute is an independent, national nonprofit dedicated to transforming the lives of children and families struggling with mental health and learning disorders. The organization’s website, <a href="https://childmind.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childmind.org</a>, provides content and resources to help those in need.</p><p>Mobile traffic has become an increased priority for the Child Mind Institute and they’ve recently implemented Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to provide a better user experience for mobile visitors. Since implementing AMP in November 2017, they now see an average page speed of 3.1 seconds compared to their previous page speed of 7 seconds.</p><h2>Growth from AddThis Share Buttons</h2><p>AMP was a huge success, and boosting social traffic was the next step to keep the momentum going. Childmind.org already had <a href="http://www.addthis.com/get/floating-share-bar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AddThis Floating Share Buttons</a> on desktop and it made sense to use <a href="http://www.addthis.com/share-buttons-for-amp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AddThis for AMP</a> and their other mobile pages. It didn’t take long for Child Mind Institute to see results—they increased shares from AMP URLs by 10% (and total shares, including non-AMP pages by 400%) and saw a 2.5% growth in new users.</p><h2>Looking Forward</h2><p>The digital team at Childmind.org is just beginning to reap the benefits of improving the mobile browsing and sharing experience. Beyond new visitor growth, increased traffic, and social shares, they’ve also seen a surge in their Facebook followers. This is a result of the huge volume of Facebook Messenger shares from their AddThis buttons on AMP. All the effort behind their mobile strategy has proved incredibly rewarding since cultivating a supportive community is an integral part of their mission as an organization. As for the future of Child Mind Institute’s relationship with both AMP and AddThis, “We can’t wait to use more of it,” Sal concludes.</p><p><strong><a href="https://blog.addthiscdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/10/04153010/AddThis-AMP-Case-Study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Click here to view the full PDF case study</a></strong></p>	</div>
