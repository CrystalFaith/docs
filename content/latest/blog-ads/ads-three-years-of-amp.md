Many publishers were concerned how this would affect their future and the promise of the open web. News publishers approached us at Google to help ensure their content was easy to distribute and read across the web. To tackle these challenges, we partnered alongside publishers and tech companies on an initiative to strengthen the web, especially on mobile. </span><b>Three years ago this month, together we </b><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/search/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages/amp/"><b>announced the launch</b></a><b> of the open source Accelerated Mobile Pages project</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. </span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Fast forward to today and there have been over 11,000 commits to the AMP code and the AMP project’s pledge to ensure the web is fast and user-friendly for everyone remains the same. Since its launch in 2015, </span><b>AMP has grown to power billions of pages across the web from tens of millions of domains</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. The project has grown from a small group of dedicated committers, to the </span><b>more than 700 contributors globally</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, with the support of hundreds of companies. And just last month, over 80 contributors met in person at the first AMP Contributor Summit.</span></p><p><a href="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png"><amp-img class=" size-full wp-image-2212 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=660" alt="AMP Timeline" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=660 660w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=1318 1318w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=150 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=300 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=768 768w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/amp_timeline.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw" width="660" height="231"></amp-img></a></p><p><b>A strong community</b></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Since 2015, we’ve seen the community come together to participate and shape the future of the project.
